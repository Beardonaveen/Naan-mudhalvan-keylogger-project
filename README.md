# Cybersecurity Keylogger Project

## Overview

This project is focused on cybersecurity and demonstrates the use of a keylogger. A keylogger is a type of spyware that secretly records keystrokes on a keyboard. This project is intended for educational purposes to understand the functioning of keyloggers and their implications in cybersecurity.

**Note:** This project should be used ethically and only in environments where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records all keystrokes made on the keyboard.
- **Data Storage:** Saves logged keystrokes in a secure and encrypted format.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring of keystrokes.
- **Data Export:** Allows exporting of recorded data for analysis.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-keylogger.git
   cd cybersecurity-keylogger
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Create and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Keylogger:**

   Execute the main script to start the keylogger:

   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

   The keylogger will now be running and recording keystrokes.

## Usage

- **Start Logging:** Run the `keylogger.py` script to start logging keystrokes.
- **Stop Logging:** Stop the script using `Ctrl+C` or terminate the process from your environment.
- **View Logs:** Logs are saved in `logs/` directory. Use the provided tools to view and analyze the logs.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Permission:** Ensure you have explicit permission to deploy or test the keylogger on any system.
- **Legal Compliance:** Follow all relevant laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity and data privacy.
- **Responsible Use:** Use this project solely for educational purposes and ethical hacking practices.
